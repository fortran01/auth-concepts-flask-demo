Alternative fix for Redis session issues.

This file provides a simpler way to fix the Redis session issues 
by downgrading Werkzeug and Flask to versions that don't have
the bytes/string incompatibility problem.

Steps to implement this fix:

1. Revert app.py to use the standard Flask-Session setup:
   - Remove the custom FixedRedisSessionInterface class
   - Keep SESSION_USE_SIGNER = True
   - Initialize Session normally with Session(app)

2. Update requirements.txt to these specific versions:
   Flask==2.0.1
   Werkzeug==2.0.1
   itsdangerous==2.0.1
   Flask-Session==0.4.0
   redis==4.3.4

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

This configuration has been tested and works correctly with Redis sessions.
