# Plan 1 Implementation: Stateful Server-Side Sessions

## Completed Tasks

1. **Updated Dependencies:**
   - Added `Flask-Session==0.5.0` and `redis==5.0.1` to `requirements.txt`
   - Added `fakeredis==2.20.0` and `mock==5.1.0` for testing

2. **Configured Flask App for Redis Sessions:**
   - Added imports: `from flask_session import Session` and `import redis`
   - Added Redis session configuration parameters before app initialization
   - Applied configuration to Flask app via `app.config.update()`
   - Initialized Session extension with `Session(app)`

3. **Created Docker Setup:**
   - Created `docker-compose.yml` for Redis service
   - Configured Redis to run in a container with persistent storage
   - Port mapping: 6379:6379

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Created `.env` file with Redis URL and Flask settings
   - Verified `.env` is already in `.gitignore`

5. **Testing Configuration:**
   - Updated `tests/conftest.py` to mock Redis for testing
   - Used `fakeredis` to create a mock Redis instance
   - Patched `flask_session.RedisSessionInterface._get_connection`

6. **Documentation:**
   - Updated `README.md` with Redis setup instructions
   - Added section explaining the Session Management approach
   - Included Redis session inspection commands

## Key Benefits of This Implementation

- **Security:** Sessions are now stored server-side, reducing the risk of session data theft
- **Control:** Server can invalidate sessions at any time (important for security)
- **Scalability:** Application can be scaled horizontally, with all instances sharing session data
- **Size:** No longer limited by cookie size restrictions for session data

## Future Improvements

- Implement session timeout configuration
- Add Redis connection health checks
- Consider adding Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for high availability
- Add additional session management endpoints (e.g., to list/revoke all user sessions)
